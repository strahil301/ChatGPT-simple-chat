employee sentiment on these changes, from \nthe end of May through mid-June we surveyed more  \nthan 12,000 professionals employed before and during COVID-19 in the US, Germany, and India. The respon-dents work in roles such as analysts, engineers, HR per -\nsonnel, teachers, and health care providers (but generally not in jobs performed onsite such as cashiers or assembly line workers). We explored their attitudes toward flexibili-ty, productivity (on individual, collaborative, and manage-rial tasks), well-being, career security, social connectivity, culture, learning and development, and the work tools they use.\nThe responses to the survey yielded unexpected insights. \nGiven the speed and scale of the pandemic-related chang-es and the fact that employers had no time to prepare staff for the shift to remote work, we expected to see a decline in employee productivity. But while some respondents did report such a drop, a surprisingly large number said they have been able to maintain or even improve their produc-tivity. The responses also reveal a significant shift in em-ployee expectations for the future of work, with a keen appetite for flexible ways of working\u2014and increased open-ness to this from managers. What\u2019s more, when we ana-lyzed what lay behind the survey results, we uncovered  key factors that are critical to maintaining and improving productivity in hybrid remote/onsite and completely  remote settings. \nIt\u2019s now clear that business as usual will be different in the \nworld of work. But if, as our survey suggests, employee productivity is possible at the height of the pandemic with little to no training or preparation, some of the new ways of working could be continued in the post-COVID-19 world. Understanding the drivers of productivity in this new envi-ronment and designing appropriate, sustainable working models are crucial to the success of work\u2014both today and tomorrow. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to economic, health, and  \nsocial devastation, it has also created an unprecedented opportunity: \nto run the world\u2019s biggest-ever workplace experiment.

Our survey found the pandemic has forced employers to move an unprecedented share of employees\u2014some 40%\u2014to re-mote working. And for those still onsite, social distancing and collaborating remotely with colleagues have trans-formed the workplace experience. Remarkably, however, instead of finding a collapse in the functioning of business, our research reveals something few might have predicted: employees perceive that their productivity has predomi-nantly stayed the same or even improved. \nWhile this is a subjective productivity indicator, the data is \nstill striking. Some 75% of employees said that during the first few months of the pandemic they have been able to maintain or improve productivity on their individual tasks (such as analyzing data, writing presentations, and execut-ing administrative tasks). On collaborative tasks (including exchanges with coworkers, working in teams, and interact-ing with clients), the number is lower. But even so, more than half\u201451%\u2014of all respondents said they have been able to maintain or improve their productivity on collabora-tive tasks. What\u2019s more, this applies across geographic areas as well as to both remote employees and those who have remained mostly onsite\u2014indicating that changes to the ways of working are having an impact across the board. (See Exhibit 1.) To understand why, we dug more deeply into the data. And we focused our analysis on collaborative tasks because, as our survey reveals, in this new remote or hybrid world, collaborative work seems harder and appears to generate the most concern among employers\u2014many of whom assume teams need to meet in person to collaborate. We found four factors that correlate with employee percep-tions of their productivity on collaborative tasks, whether working remotely or onsite: social connectivity, mental health, physical health, and workplace tools. \nAn impressive 79% of respondents who indicated they are \nsatisfied or doing better on all four of these factors said they have been able to maintain or improve productivity on collaborative tasks. In contrast, employee dissatisfaction with a high number of these factors is cause for concern. When we looked at respondents who are dissatisfied or doing worse on at least three factors, only 16% (from a small sample size, with a confidence interval of +/- 3% at 80% confidence) said they have been able to maintain or improve productivity. That\u2019s a difference of almost 400%! \nWe now walk through each factor in turn. \nSocial Connectivity. Most surprising in our analysis is the \noutsize impact that social connectivity has on productivity: employees who reported satisfaction with social connec-  \ntivity with their colleagues are two to three times more  \nlikely to have maintained or improved their productivity on  \nExhibit 1 - Many People Have Maintained or Improved Productivity During \nCOVID-19, but Fewer Have Done So on Collaborative Tasks\nSource: BCG COVID-19 Employee Sentiment Survey, May 21 to June 13, 2020 (N = 12,662 in the US, Germany, and India), unweighted, representative \nwithin +/-3% of census demographics.\nNote: \u201cStayed onsite\u201d are respondents who reported working a majority of their time (\u2265 3 days per week) onsite prior to and during the COVID-19 \npandemic; \u201cstayed remote\u201d worked \u2265 3 days per week remotely prior to and during the pandemic; \u201ctransitioned to remote\u201d reported switching from working \u2265 3 days per week onsite prior to the pandemic to working \u2265 3 days per week remotely during the pandemic.\nIndividual tasks (%) Managerial tasks (%)\nStayed\nonsiteStayed\nremoteTransitioned\nto remote\nAs productive or more productive \nthan", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3826, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "887211e5-84a8-4f19-961c-3d5fca5d7196": {"__data__": {"id_": "887211e5-84a8-4f19-961c-3d5fca5d7196", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0fd0de4-afa9-4f4b-b6f8-5cb34589fda9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "b9084115da40d6aeaac19b9d184f37fbd7c60984456b020d647af8a6464e67e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe8d6ea9-d3e9-478f-906c-ac994618cb15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "4a49e8a7cb07796844b1469481bb0059712e3dd43e77c12edf82d0b51ff43af9"}}, "hash": "9b7b4525513501ecd1799eb6f0c342be3d339b4a93f33386397bf855f18a883a", "text": "remote\nAs productive or more productive \nthan pre-COVID-19Less productive than pre-COVID-19Stayed\nonsiteStayed\nremoteTransitioned\nto remoteCollaborative tasks (%)\nStayed\nonsiteStayed\nremoteTransitioned\nto remote74\n2664\n3666\n3460\n4055\n4556\n44445677\n237624\nEmployers need to unlock productivity on collaborative tasks, especially if employees work remotely", "start_char_idx": 3781, "end_char_idx": 4135, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf0d67c7-6360-4bf0-8fdf-03ca1cb11ceb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf0d67c7-6360-4bf0-8fdf-03ca1cb11ceb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4ec2d71-f014-42f9-8de8-27e42f426f80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "e1fbb2a6ac1c7472a73ffa70df8d4733749d7aff2533804cc02d3487d219747e"}}, "hash": "e1fbb2a6ac1c7472a73ffa70df8d4733749d7aff2533804cc02d3487d219747e", "text": "The survey findings show that  \nsocial connectivity is what enables \nus to be collaboratively productive.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 105, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91ea4794-e8db-46e2-8bfb-133db71461e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "91ea4794-e8db-46e2-8bfb-133db71461e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f30e8690-b6d6-4d77-a7c8-631c8b92b10c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "f626f1a2e3936e7029e28ebe45a5667df8f6a35bea7985518484c562ad02744a"}}, "hash": "f626f1a2e3936e7029e28ebe45a5667df8f6a35bea7985518484c562ad02744a", "text": "4 WHA T 12,000 EMPLOYEES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF REMOTE WORK\ncollaborative tasks than those who are dissatisfied with their \nconnections. (See Exhibit 2.) Social connectivity, it turns out, \nis what enables us to be collaboratively productive. And collaborative productivity is essential for any company look -\ning to improve communication, increase efficiency, accelerate skills ac\nquisition, or harness innovation. \nFurthermore, our survey suggests that employees miss the connectivity they had with colleagues in the office. Respon-dents told us they miss \u201cbeing able to spontaneously walk to a coworker\u2019s desk and discuss an issue\u201d and \u201csocial gatherings at work. \u201d It will be critical for companies to recreate this connectivity regardless of where employees are located.\nMental Health. Similarly, survey responses show a cor-\nrelation between mental health and productivity: people who have experienced better mental health during the pandemic than before it are about two times more likely to maintain or improve their productivity on collaborative tasks than those who have experienced worse mental health. While awareness of the impact of mental health on work has been increasing, the pandemic\u2014and the stresses and anxieties it has created\u2014underscores how critical it is for employers to recognize the links between mental health and productivity. Physical Health. For a long time, physical health has been recognized as a driver of productivity, reducing absen-teeism and creating a more focused, higher-performing workforce. Our findings provide compelling evidence of this: employees who have experienced better physical health during the pandemic than before it are about twice as likely to have maintained or improved their productivity on collaborative tasks as those with worse physical health. This highlights the importance of building time for sleep, exercise, and nutrition into the new work routines.\nWorkplace Tools. When we asked respondents about \ntheir satisfaction with tools such as videoconferencing, virtual white boards, and project management software, we found another powerful driver of productivity: employees who are satisfied with their tools are about twice as likely to have maintained or improved their productivity on collaborative tasks as those not satisfied with their tools. One tech industry respondent said that \u201chaving a desk setup the same as the office and home with the same connectivity\u201d is essential for him in maintaining productivi-ty, while other respondents reported that digital applica-tions and tools such as videoconferencing are important to maintaining their productivity levels. \nExhibit 2 - Employees Satisfied with Social Connectivity Are More Likely to \nMaintain or Improve Productivity on Collaborative Tasks\nSource: BCG COVID-19 Employee Sentiment Survey, May 21 to June 13, 2020 (N = 12,662 in the US, Germany, and India), unweighted, representative \nwithin +/-3% of census demographics.\nUS Germany\nAs productive or more productive \nthan pre-COVID-19Less productive than pre-COVID-19India\nNot satis\ufb01ed with social connectivity\n3.2x 1.9x 2.4xSatis\ufb01ed with social connectivityNot satis\ufb01ed with social connectivitySatis\ufb01ed with social connectivityNot satis\ufb01ed with social connectivitySatis\ufb01ed with social connectivity\n20%63%\n37%\n80%27%\n73%24%\n76%58%\n42%50%\n50%", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3335, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1bffe5e-952d-4090-a527-5b9759864cb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1bffe5e-952d-4090-a527-5b9759864cb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b000e5a7-c7ed-462d-985c-b587869db68d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "95f5664580c701106225673b6321b335ad093e0dac209c28695695c23ed2f848"}}, "hash": "95f5664580c701106225673b6321b335ad093e0dac209c28695695c23ed2f848", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP  5A New World of Work\nShifts in the way we work are likely to continue as employ -\ners move a growing portion of their employees to more \nflexible models. In fact, BCG\u2019s recent Workplace of the Future employer survey found that companies expect about 40% of their employees to follow a remote-working model in the future.\nOne financial services company told us it believes a hybrid \nmodel (rather than 100% remote) would likely be the working model of choice for many of its employees, who see 100% remote work as unsustainable. The company said that its employees worked an estimated 25% of their time remotely before the pandemic, and it believes that this figure could rise to approximately 50% or more.\nEmployer expectations are in line with the seismic shift in \nthe way employees are thinking about their workplace. In our research, 60% of employees said they want some flexi-bility in where and/or when they work. (See Exhibit 3.) This response was most pronounced in the US (67%), while the figure was 50% in India. Combined with our findings on what drives employee productivity, this underscores the fact that listening and responding to what employees want are essential to a company\u2019s success, including its ability to attract and retain talent .It is encouraging, therefore, that managers appear recep-tive to flexible models. In our survey, we were struck to find that of respondents who are managers\u2014and some might not expect all managers to welcome increased flexibility\u2014most are in fact very open to this. Over 70% of managers said they are more open to flexible models for their teams than they were before the pandemic.\nWhat This Means for Employers\nOur findings suggest that the future of work will be increas-ingly hybrid. And this presents both challenges and oppor-tunities: to reimagine the entire employee experience and to create conditions that allow employees to thrive in the workplace of the future\u2014one that will be far less office centric. This means developing new hybrid working models that enable employees to move seamlessly between onsite and remote work, as well as thinking about the appropriate physical space\u2014both size and shape\u2014for the hybrid office.\nSome challenges are more demanding than others. The \ngood news is that companies have already been investing heavily in the tools needed to work remotely. In our Work-place of the Future survey, 87% of employers said they anticipate prioritizing tech and digital infrastructure invest-ments that support sustained remote work. \nExhibit 3 - A Majority of Respondents Want Some Flexibility in Where \nand/or When They Get Their Work Done\nSource: BCG COVID-19 Employee Sentiment Survey, May 21 to June 13, 2020 (N = 12,662 in the US, Germany, and India), unweighted, representative \nwithin +/-3% of census demographics.\nNote: Numbers do not total 100% because of rounding.\nFuture desire for\n\u201cwhere\u201d \ufb02exibility\nFuture desire for \u201cwhen\u201d  \ufb02exibilitySome \ufb02exibility\nin where I workSome \ufb02exibility in both\nwhen and where I work\n8% 40%\nof respondents of respondents\nLow to no \ufb02exibility in\nwhen and where I workSome \ufb02exibility\nin when I work\n39% 12%\nof respondents of respondentsSometimes,\nmost of the time,\nor almost always\nLess than\nsometimes\nLess than sometimes\nRespondent indicates a desire for where and/or when \ufb02exibility\nsometimes, most of the time, or almost always (i.e., \u201csome\u201d \ufb02exibility)KeySometimes, most of the time,\nor almost always60% of respondents indicate they want some \ufb02exibility in where and/or when they work in the future\nRespondent does not indicate a desire for where and/or when \ufb02exibilitysometimes, most of the time, or almost always (i.e., \u201clow to no\u201d \ufb02exibility)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f621b4b9-c85c-44f1-9cca-9ed9b664d40b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f621b4b9-c85c-44f1-9cca-9ed9b664d40b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ca236c1-24c0-4f64-bbc9-b36cbdbe111f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "6e50518811d31faf15d3eacf02ef33877b78f699b6b3b450082d3c09ac6ef14f"}}, "hash": "6e50518811d31faf15d3eacf02ef33877b78f699b6b3b450082d3c09ac6ef14f", "text": "The future of work will be  \nincreasingly hybrid\u2014a blend of onsite and remote locations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 88, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2258752-b907-44f8-be8f-bd9260ef745f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2258752-b907-44f8-be8f-bd9260ef745f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dc7eacc7-162c-49d2-8164-8cc55b5e1a35", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "1c87bc517efcbdbd2061df78dee6b6a7b196a58ef4883a6699b1780b4acf0610"}, "3": {"node_id": "26c31766-816b-4966-885d-3518f6bf8e38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "dc57664c07b6d8c937062c9e23e9f44c0c15abe5614a7a7db2fa8a18a852bdb1"}}, "hash": "860eb4fbe0696121822592f20f96b668597e368d687ca0ed537e3e69618f5708", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP  7\nWhen it comes to promoting good employee health, com-\npanies need to focus on both physical health and mental well-being. While employees who are no longer commuting have more time to exercise, it is easy for them to be seden-tary when working remotely. Meanwhile, with 29% of re-spondents telling us they have experienced worse overall mental health during COVID-19, it is imperative for em-ployers to create awareness and develop tools and benefits that support employees\u2019 needs. Many companies are experimenting with new approaches, as P&G Indian Sub-continent is doing by inviting employees to webinars with emotional well-being experts, according to a recent report from the Economic Times of India. \nPerhaps most challenging, but with the highest payback, \nwill be figuring out how to maximize the social connectivity that takes place in the office. When employees are working remotely, it is hard to replicate the spontaneity of the \u201cwater cooler moment\u201d or the camaraderie created by an impromptu lunch, a hallway conversation, or even a fire drill. But even those can be recreated with impromptu calls, whether by phone or FaceTime. And that\u2019s important, not just for employees at home but for those onsite, where social-distancing practices and the fact that many col-leagues are accessible only via video will hamper the kind of social connectivity that took place before the pandemic. \nIt is too soon to provide all the answers. But employers \nshould ask themselves a number of key questions as they work to design customized solutions. In the following sections, we present some of these questions, along with examples of solutions that could spark ideas. \nSocial Connectivity. Recreating social connectivity in \nvirtual and hybrid settings is tough but essential. And this will be even more critical as companies start to hire new employees who have not built social capital from pre-COVID-19 times. \nSome key questions to consider:\u2022\n How do y\nou foster a culture in which leaders see it  \nas their responsibility to design and execute social-  \nconnectivity strategies and practices for their teams?\n\u2022\n When emplo\nyees work remotely, how do you replicate \nthe ad hoc, serendipitous encounters with colleagues \nwho work on the same team or were once down the hallway?\n\u2022\n How do y\nou build social capital with new employees who \nare fully remote?\u2022  How do y ou maintain team cohesion when some people \nare working remotely while others are onsite? \n\u2022\n How do y\nou create deep social connectivity in a dis-\ntanced world where everyone wears a mask, which  hides many telling facial expressions?\nEarly Solutions. As they recognize the power of social con-nectivity at work, employers are thinking about how to replicate some of the more informal interactions that take place in physical workplaces. We see a number of compa-nies coming up with creative ideas.\nOnline services company GitLab encourages employees to \nset aside a few hours per week for virtual coffee breaks and to use Slack for informal connections and conversations. It has also created a \u201cRandom Room\u201d on Google Hangouts where anyone can drop in, mimicking unplanned social interactions or water cooler moments.\n1\nAs described in a recent post from one of our BCG leaders, the serendipity of impromptu hallway or cafeteria-style meetings can be recreated by randomly FaceTiming team members to ask how they are doing. \nCompanies can also try to make virtual team activities fun. \nClevertech, a software company, encourages its employees to play videogames that simulate a collaborative environ-ment and enable complex problems to be solved by the group.\n2\nMental Health.

Companies need to find ways of supporting \nemployees\u2019 mental health in the new remote and hybrid workplace. From free therapy sessions to educational efforts, companies are starting to develop solutions to this challenge.\nFront, a workplace-communications platform provider, \noffers an employee assistance program in the form of a confidential counseling service to help employees with challenges related to work, family, stress, finances, and other personal issues. \nAccording to the Economic Times of India, Microsoft India is \nbringing in experts to educate leaders and employees on the importance of mental health and well-being during these challenging times. \nEmployers can also make a therapist available for confi-\ndential appointments. In March, for example, Starbucks announced that it would provide all its US-based employ-ees and eligible family members with 20 free therapy sessions a year, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nPhysical Health. A productive workforce is a healthy \nworkforce. This means promoting positive healthy behav-iors in the remote and hybrid workplace. \nSome key questions to consider:\u2022\n Without b\neing able to provide access to a corporate gym, \nwhat other benefits, incentives, and structures might you \nput in place to encourage physical well-being?\n\u2022\n How do y\nou create team-level work-life balance?\nEarly Solutions. To encourage employees\u2019 physical health, employers need to create new structures that make it easy for employees to remain fit and well. These can either be offered as benefits or be built into the workday itself.\nBCG has created wellness challenges for employees and \nhighlighted winners in the company newsletter. In addition, many BCG offices offer meditation sessions, online fitness classes, and health webinars. \nEmployers can also consider scheduling regular meetings \nwhile out walking in order to build physical fitness into the workday. \nTo create team-level work-life balance, one approach is to \ncarve out work-free hours every evening or set limits on how early or late work calls can be scheduled. Workplace Tools. Given the ubiquity of digital technology in the traditional workplace, the virtual or hybrid version needs to replicate this. Employers must use these tools to make it easy for employees not only to carry out their daily tasks but also to collaborate with their teams and other members of the organization\u2014wherever they are located.\nKey questions to consider:\u2022\n What digit\nal tools do employees need in a non-office- \ncentric workplace\u2014particularly to support collaborative \ntasks?\n\u2022\n What r\nole does the company play in either providing \nthe physical tools and equipment needed to work from home, such as external monitors and ergonomic chairs, or compensating employees so that they can purchase them?\n\u2022\n When part of the t\neam is in the office and part of it is at \nhome, how do you develop norms to ensure that every-one feels included?\n\u2022\n F\nor those working at home, how do you create the sense \nof a workplace?\nEarly Solutions. Some companies were already investing in tools for the virtual workplace before the COVID-19 out-break. But the pandemic has accelerated the rate at which employers are coming up with ways to ensure that employ-ees have all the equipment they need to work efficiently, even when working remotely.\nCisco got ahead of the game. Even before COVID-19, it \nroutinely invested in setting up its TelePresence system\u2014videoconferencing technology that makes two physically separate rooms resemble a single space\u2014in the homes of its managers and leaders to ensure that they remain pro-ductive when working remotely and to facilitate virtual collaboration. \nCompanies have reacted swiftly to the changes.

Given what our data reveals on this, all companies should be urgently investing in building their virtual social-intimacy muscles.They also need to make transitions between onsite and remote work as smooth as possible, giving employees a cohesive experience that feels designed, not random, and allows them to perform at their best whether onsite or working remotely. \nThis crisis has presented a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \nto reinvent the workplace. Things that might once have seemed impossible have proved surprisingly workable. With collaborative productivity essential to innovation, the changes will enable companies to become more competi-tive. And given employee desires for flexibility, the changes will also allow companies to recruit and retain the best talent . \nMoreover, focusing on well-being and social connectivity will serve another important purpose: helping employees to recover faster from what, for so many people, has been a traumatic, painful, and stressful period. And that is not only good for business\u2014it is good for people.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2251, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca767c7e-1e8d-41a9-aee0-5fc1a9348d7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca767c7e-1e8d-41a9-aee0-5fc1a9348d7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a5dceca-4d7b-4b46-8d24-c52fd9d297db", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "bcg-what-12000-employees-have-to-say-about-the-future-aug-2020.pdf"}, "hash": "070724e47b62a87bbbd919a9d81ae2ddc5a060308a7c50a6752aa1fafd2c7710"}}, "hash": "070724e47b62a87bbbd919a9d81ae2ddc5a060308a7c50a6752aa1fafd2c7710", "text": "BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP  1 1\nAbout the Authors\nAdriana Dahik is a managing director and partner in the \nSan Francisco office of Boston Consulting Group.
